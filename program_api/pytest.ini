markers =
    unit: Pure logic tests with no external dependencies (fast, isolated)
    integration: Tests using FastAPI TestClient with fake repositories
    contract: API response shape and OpenAPI schema validation tests
    e2e: End-to-end tests hitting real services (optional, nightly runs only)
    slow: Tests that take a long time to run (large programs, performance tests)
    timeout: Marks test with a specific timeout in seconds (requires pytest-timeout)
