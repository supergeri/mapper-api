markers =
    unit: Pure logic tests with no external dependencies (fast, isolated)
    golden: Snapshot tests for export output validation (deterministic output comparison)
    integration: Tests using FastAPI TestClient with fake repositories
    contract: API response shape and OpenAPI schema validation tests
    e2e: End-to-end tests hitting real services (optional, nightly runs only)
